                <p>
                    Having the skills to tackle financial problems is becoming increasingly difficult for children resulting in an increase in higher average debt for people under the age of 30. What's the problem? It's quite simple.

                  Parents and schools are not teaching students what it means to use money responsibly. Instead of focusing on how to earn money ethically and use it in the right places, schools are focused on delivering education that grew outdated years ago. But no worries. Now that Bankology is here, we can fix the growing lack of financial knowledge in the next generation. With our student designed introductory courses to extremely important topics like: Finance in the Real World, Investing and the Stock Market, Banking, and also Entrepreneurship, we can give students the proper financial education they deserve.
