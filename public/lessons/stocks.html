            <h1>Stock Market</h1>
            <p>
                The stock market is a crazy place, and it is constantly changing. If you invest in a company that ends up crashing, then you can lose tons of money. However If you invest in a company that rockets then you can make tons of money. Because the stock market is so crazy, and stocks sometimes only crash for a day and come back up in value the next day, there are so many opportunities to invest. For a beginner one tip for investing in the stock market is to wait until the stock crashes, and the cost of a share is lower to invest, so that when it comes back up again you will have less money to pay off.

            <h2>Investing in the Stock Market</h2>
            <p>
                When investing in stock it can often be a long term investment. The goal of investing in stock is to start with a company that has a low amount of money per share and by the end the company should be worth more than it started as and in turn you made money off that stock. If your investment pays off and the company is worth a lot and you think that it wonâ€™t improve anymore or it will start to go down soon. You should consider selling it. By selling stock at its peak, you can sell it for the most money. It is also important to try to sell it at its peak because if it starts to go down, then you lose money, and your investment might not end up paying off.

                 When you invest in stock it is good to be proactive, however, if you have more money, you have more that you can risk in the stock market. When you are young and you are coming out of college probably with student debt, and not a high income bracket yet, you can still invest.  Even though you may have less money to invest when you are younger, it is still important to invest because your money will have more time to grow in the market.
