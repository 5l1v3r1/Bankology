      <h1>Stock Market</h1>
      <p>
        The stock market is constantly changing and has many factors that impact it. Choosing the right company to invest in can make your life but choosing the wrong company can severely hurt your bank balance. A key thing to know before investing in stocks is understanding what makes a stock price change. The stock price is impacted by a simple principle called supply and demand. If a company’s goods are in high demand, then the stock price will generally be going up. However, stock price is also dependent on outside factors such as the public’s views of a company. If a company is viewed negatively by the public then it will decrease in its stock value. On the other hand, if people feel confident about a company, it’s stock price will increase. These are not all the factors that impact a stock.

      <h2>Investing in the Stock Market</h2>
      <p>
        Know that when investing in stock short term investments are rare. The goal of investing in stock is to generate return over time, not instantaneous profit. Therefore it is important that you do your research on a company before investing in it. Look at factors such as its product, growth trends, leadership and management, well as public feelings towards the company. Another important factor to consider is the amount of excess money you have left over and whether using it in the stock market is right for you. Many people think that stock market investing is only for the rich or those who have way too much extra money, but that is not the case. Anybody can invest in the stock market as long as you put in the time and effort to understand it.
