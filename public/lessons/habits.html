      <h1>Spending Wisely</h1>
      <p>
        Spending wisely is when you  budget your money so that you can have enough money for basic needs, wants, and savings. For example some people use the 50 30 20 rule. The 50 30 20 rule divides you money into three basic categories; needs, wants, savings. It is divided into 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings. Although this is a good starting point, it is important to note that everyone is in a different situation, so your categories and percentages are going to be different.

        Spending wisely is a very important skill to have because when you are young, your parents do it for you. However as you grow up it is important to budget your own money so that you don't go into debt. Falling into debt is very easy if you don’t budget your money because if you don’t have a limit on how much to spend, you will probably go over how much money you have available. One thing to note is that although you should try to stay to this plan, sometimes you have to go outside of the budget, and that is okay. The most important thing is to get back into the routine of the budget, after you go outside of it.

        Spending wisely is not always easy. When you walk into a store, and you see something that you really want, what do you do. You will probably put it in your cart because you didn’t stop to think about if it will fit into your budget. I find that the easiest way to stay on budget is to get the stuff that you originally came to the store to get, and get those. IF you have extra room in your budget you can spend it but also not that if you don’t spend it now, you can spend it later on something more important.
