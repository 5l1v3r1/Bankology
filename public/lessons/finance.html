      <h1>Finance in the Real World</h1>
      <p>
        Money is anywhere and everywhere and therefore, it is very important to understand how money works. There are many ways in which you can obtain money for a purchase.
      </p>
      <h2>Loans</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most common ways of borrowing money is from a bank in the form of a loan. A loan is a binding agreement between the borrower and the Bank. The bank will give you a certain amount of money but in return it asks that you not only pay the money back, but give the bank some additional money, in the form of interest. In a loan, there are two types of payments, the principal payment and the interest payment. The principal payment goes directly towards paying the original loan amount, whereas the interest goes to the bank or lender. In short, principal is the money that you originally agreed to pay back, and interest is the cost of borrowing the principal.

      <h2>Debt</h2>
      <p>
        Before taking out a loan- whether it is for buying a house, a car, or for starting a company is- know that you are putting yourself in debt. It is very important to understand what debt is. Debt is the amount of money that a person owes someone because they have borrowed money from them. In the U.S., almost 40% of American families carry in excess of $15,000 in credit card debt with normal interest rates that exceed 13%. It is very clear that we have a debt problem in our society. However, to counter this debt problem, we must realize when it is right(and smart) to take on debt and when it is wrong(and foolish) to take on debt. So when should we take on some more debt? The answer is: it depends on your circumstances. How your life is at that moment will decide whether or not you should take on debt. But there are a few scenarios that we can give you to make this process easier. The general rule of thumb is that the farther you are from debt, the better your life will be. However, there are times when taking on debt may be beneficial but these are very specific circumstances. A good example would be if you are taking out a loan for a new house. Usually a house is the most expensive purchase that a person makes and having enough money in the bank to pay the house in full, is generally not the case. A reason that taking on debt to purchase a house can be a good idea is because of a return of investment from a real estate perspective. We will talk more about investing in the next chapter but the key takeaway is that: as the population grows and land becomes more scarce, the price of land will increase, thus allowing you to make extra money if you were to sell your house later.
